# python-1stAssignment<br>
Introduction of python:<br>
Python was created by Guido van Rossum, and first released on February 20, 1991.<br>
It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code.<br>
Python programming language is being used in web development, Machine Learning applications.<br>
Python language is being used by almost all tech-giant companies like – Google, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, Dropbox,etc.<br>

Python 3 basics:<br>
Basics of Python 3, one of the most powerful, versatile, and in-demand programming languages today.<br>
some basics is below;<br>
Variables: Example, x = 5 creates a variable called x and assigns the value 5 to it.<br>
Data types: Data types, including integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.<br>
Operators: operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (>, <, ==, !=), and logical operators (and, or, not).<br>
Control flow statements: Several control flow statements, including if-else statements, for loops, and while loops
Functions.<br>

Python the new-generation language:<br>
Python – The new generation Language" suggests that Python is perceived as a modern, versatile, and influential programming language due to its simple syntax, broad applications, rapid development capabilities, active community, dominance in data science and AI/ML, and support for various programming paradigms.
Based on predictions, it is estimated that the Python language will continue to be used for the next 20 years.so, we can say that its new generation language.

what is python 3 and why do we programming?<br>
Python 3 is a high-level language that has a large standard library and many third-party libraries available, making it a versatile language that can be used for a wide variety of applications.<br>
And we do programming because The python language is one of the most accessible programming languages available because it has simplified syntax and not complicated, which gives more emphasis on natural language.<br>
Due to its ease of learning and usage, python codes can be easily written and executed much faster than other programming languages.<br>


why python is leading edge?<br>
The language boasts the easiest syntax of any programming language currently in use,<br>
places a greater emphasis on natural language, and is, therefore, the most approachable.<br>

What is the major difference between python 3.x and 2.x?with example.<br>
Python 2:<br> 
Python 2 has more complicated syntax than Python 3.<br>                                         
Python 2 stores need to define Unicode string value with “u.”<br> 
Python 2 value of the global variable will be changed while using it inside for-loop.<br>                                                                                          
for example:<br>                                                                                                                                                           
<pre><br>                                                                                    
  print"Hello,world"<br>                                                                         
</pre<br>
<br>
Python 3:<br>
Python 3 has an easier syntax compared to Python 2.<br>
Python 3 default storing of strings is Unicode.<br>
Python 3 value of variables never changes.<br>

for example:<br>                                                                                                                                                           
<pre><br> 
   print(Hello,world)<br>
